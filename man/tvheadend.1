.SH "LOGGING"
All activity inside Tvheadend is logged to syslog using log facility
\fBLOG_DAEMON\fR.
.SH "SETUP"
.SS "Access to video adapters"
In order for Tvheadend to control the video adapters on the system it
must be granted access to those devices. Most systems have a 'video'
group with write access to the video adapter devices. When Tvheadend
is started as a daemon it will automatically change its primary group
to 'video' in order to access these groups. 
.PP
If your system is configured in a different way you can either change 
the group membership of the video adapters (/dev/dvb, etc) or reconfigure 
the Tvheadend startup parameters. This is most likely the behavior if you 
have installed Tvheadend from a distribution package.
.PP
If Tvheadend is started without the '-f' argument it will neither daemonize
nor change its primary userid/groupid. Instead, it will run with the permissions
granted to the user executing the binary. If that's the case then you must make
sure that the current user is granted access to the video devices.
.SS "Configuration"
All configuration in Tvheadend is maintained via its embedded web server running on port 9981. Just point your browser to:
.PP
.nf
   http://hostname:9981/
.fi
.PP
By default \fIeveryone (also from remote hosts)\fR is allowed \fIfull\fR
access to \fIall\fR features / settings in the web user interface. If
this is the first time you're setting up Tvheadend, you are strongly encouraged
to enter the web user interface, selected the 'Configuration' + 'Access Control'
tab and make reasonable changes. Further help and documentation can be obtained
inside the web interface.
.SS "Settings"
Settings are stored in the current user's home directory. Thus, if Tvheadend
is run as a system daemon a dedicated user needs to be created and Tvheadend
should be launched with the '-u' argument. Also notice that XMLTV will read/
store cache and configuration from the same user home directory.
.PP
If daemonizing, Tvheadend will writes its pid in /var/run/tvheadend.pid
