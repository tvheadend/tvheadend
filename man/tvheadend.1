access-control from within the Tvheadend UI.
.SH "LOGGING"
All activity inside tvheadend is logged to syslog using log facility
\fBLOG_DAEMON\fR.
.SH "SETUP"
.SS "Access to video adapters"
In order for Tvheadend to control the video adapters on the system it
must be granted access to those devices. Most systems have a 'video'
group with write access to the video adapter devices. When Tvheadend
is started as a daemon it will automatcially change its primary group
to 'video' in order to access these groups. If your system is configured
in a different way you can either change the group membership of the
video adapters (/dev/dvb, etc) or reconfigure the Tvheadend startup
parameters. This is most likely the behaviour if you have installed
Tvheadend from a distribution package.
.PP
If Tvheadend is started without the '-f' argument it will not daemonize
nor change its primary userid/groupid. Rather it will run with the permissions
granted to the user executing the binary. If that's the case you must make
sure the current user is granted with access to the video devices.
.SS "Configuration"
All configuration in Tvheadend is maintained via its embedded web server running on port 9981. Just point your browser to:
.PP
.nf
   http://hostname:9981/
.fi
.PP
By default \fIeveryone (also from remote hosts)\fR is allowed \fIfull\fR
access to \fIall\fR features / settings in the web user interface. If
this is the first time you setup Tvheadend you are most encouraged to
enter the web user interface, selected the 'Configuration' + 'Access Control'
tab and make reasonable changes. Futher help / documentationcan be obtained
inside the web interface.
.SS "Settings"
Settings are stored in the current users home directory. Thus, if Tvheadend
is run as a system daemon a dedicated user needs to be created and Tvheadend
should be launched with the '-u' argument. Also notice that XMLTV will read
store cache and configuration from the user home directory.
.PP
If daemonizing, tvheadend will writes it pid in /var/run/tvheadend.pid
