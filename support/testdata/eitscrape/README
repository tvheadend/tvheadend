This directory contains input test files for the EIT scraper
functionality.  These are run with the eitscrape_test.py which takes
as input a parser file from support/testdata/eitscrape/ and one of
these input files.

It then outputs OK or FAIL for every test case.

The format is JSON.

Input:
- "comment" - explanation for the test if there is something unusual
      about it such as broadcaster reversing episode and season.

- "title" - title field from EIT broadcast that will be scraped.

- "summary" - summary field from EIT broadcast that will be scraped.

- "language" - optional 3 character ISO 639-2 B language code
               string specifying the title and summary language.

Expected Result:

- 'age', 'airdate', 'comment', 'episode', 'genre', 'season',
  'new_title', 'new_subtitle', 'new_summary':
   expected scraped values. "null" is an accepted value such as '"season": null'
   for cases that should explicitly not set season.

   Currently we do not scrape age (12, 15, 18 etc) or genre but it is
   included since some broadcasters have this information in the
   summary and it may be supported in the future.

- if different scraper values are expected for different regex engines,
  give expected scraper values for a particular regex engine ('pcre',
  'pcre1', 'pcre2') by appending a colon and the name of the engine
  to the field name, e.g. 'new_title:pcre'.
