# CSV for mapping xmltv categories to epg genres.
# Format:
# genre, cat1, cat2, cat3...
#
# First column is genre from epg.c.
#
# Remaining columns (which can be multiple) are categories that map
# on to that category.
#
# You only need to include mappings which are not already
# one-to-one. For example, SD uses "Documentary" which exactly
# matches epg genre of "Documentary", so there is no need to
# include it here.
