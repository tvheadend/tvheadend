If you want to build tvheadend from source, please visit 
<a href="http://trac.lonelycoder.com/hts/wiki/howtobuildhts">this</a> page.
Please notice that wiki development site only reflects the work
in HEAD (-current). It should not deviate much should you want to
build a released version from source, but you never know.
<p>

Tvheadend is part of the <b>HTS</b> project hosted at
<a href="http://hts.lonelycoder.com/">http://hts.lonelycoder.com/</a>.

<p>
It functions primarily as a TV backend for the Showtime Mediaplayer but
can be used standalone for other purposes.
