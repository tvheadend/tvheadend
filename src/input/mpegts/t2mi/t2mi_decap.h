/*
 * Extracts an inner MPEG-TS from a carrier PID of an outer MPEG-TS.
 * Two carrier formats are supported:
 *
 *   T2MI_DECAP_FORMAT_T2MI - DVB-T2 Modulator Interface packets
 *     (ETSI TS 102 773) delivered via DVB data piping (EN 301 192);
 *     the inner TS is rebuilt from the baseband frames of one PLP.
 *
 *   T2MI_DECAP_FORMAT_PIPE - plain "TS in TS" data piping where the
 *     carrier PID payload bytes are the inner TS byte stream
 *     (used e.g. by the Abertis/Cellnex DTT distribution on Hispasat).
 *
 *   T2MI_DECAP_FORMAT_AUTO probes the stream and locks on whichever
 *   format is detected first.
 *
 * The engine has no tvheadend dependencies and only requires aligned
 * 188-byte packets of the (descrambled) carrier PID as input.
 *
 * Adding another carrier encapsulation (for example BTS for ISDB-T or
 * STL-TP for ATSC 3.0) is meant to be self-contained: define a new
 * T2MI_DECAP_FORMAT_* value below, add its per-packet handler alongside
 * t2mi_decap_bbframe()/t2mi_decap_pipe_input() in t2mi_decap.c, give it
 * a branch in the format dispatch and a signature in the auto-detect
 * probe, and expose it in t2mi_mux_class_format_list().  The outer
 * carrier framing, PID handling, descrambling and inner-TS re-injection
 * are format-independent and need no change.
