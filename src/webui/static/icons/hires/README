These fonts are used for displaying icons in the UI.

Currently this uses the Google noto font with mappings
in the tvheadend.js.

If adding more mappings then see the icon list at:

The names of the files are based on the official unicode name.
In Emacs you could use "M-x insert-char" to insert the character
and then "M-x describe-char" to describe it and it will tell
you the official name.
