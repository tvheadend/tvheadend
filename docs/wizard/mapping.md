Map all discovered services to channels.


In order for your frontend client(s) (such as Kodi, Movian, and similar)
to see/play channels, you must first map discovered services to
channels.


If you would like Tvheadend to do this for you, check the
'Map all services' option below, but be aware that this will also map
encrypted services you may not have access to.


**You may omit this step (do not check 'Map all services') and
map services to channels manually.**


**Notes**:
* Many providers include undesirable services - Teleshopping, Adult
  Entertainment, etc; using the 'Map all services' will include these.
