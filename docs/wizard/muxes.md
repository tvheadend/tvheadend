Assign predefined muxes to networks. To save you from manually entering
muxes, Tvheadend includes predefined mux lists. Please select an option 
from the list for each network.

Note, the pre-defined lists are not always up-to-date, this generally 
isn't a problem provided that one of the muxes in list 
is active, and contains network information. 

**If you don't see any options below, you need to go back and assign a 
network type to a tuner.**
