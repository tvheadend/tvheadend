Assign predefined muxes to networks. To save you from manually entering
muxes, Tvheadend includes predefined mux lists. Please select an option 
from the list for each network.

Note, the pre-defined lists are not always up-to-date, this generally 
isn't a problem provided that one of the muxes - in the predefined list - 
is active, and contains network information.
