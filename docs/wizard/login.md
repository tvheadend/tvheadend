Enter the access control details to secure your system.

The first part of this covers the network details
for address-based access to the system; for example,
192.168.1.0/24 to allow local access only to 192.168.1.x clients,
or 0.0.0.0/0 or empty value for access from any system.


This works alongside the second part, which is a familiar
username/password combination, so provide these for both
an administrator and regular (day-to-day) user.
