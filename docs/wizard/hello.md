Welcome to Tvheadend, your TV streaming server and video recorder. This 
wizard will help you get up and running fast. Let's start by configuring 
the basic language settings. Please select the default user interface 
and EPG language(s).

**This wizard should only be run on initial setup. Please cancel it if 
you're not willing to touch the current configuration, as continuing in 
such cases can lead to misconfiguration and not all changes made thru 
this wizard will take effect.**


**Notes**:
* If you cannot see your preferred language in the language list and would 
like to help translate Tvheadend see 
[here](https://tvheadend.org/projects/tvheadend/wiki/Internationalization). 
* If you don't enter a preferred language, US English will be used as a default. 
* Not selecting the correct EPG 
language can result in garbled EPG text; if this happens, don't panic, 
as you can easily change it later.

**The interface will reload in your chosen language (if the translation is available).**
