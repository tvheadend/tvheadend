## Overview

Tvheadend is a lightweight, easily-configured, general-purpose TV/video
streaming server and recorder (PVR/DVR) for GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and Android.

![Tvheadend interface](static/img/doc/introduction/screenshot.png)

It supports input from a number of sources such as DVB-T, DVB-S and more, see 
[Features](#features) for a full list.

As well as being able to record the input, Tvheadend also offers it up to
client applications via HTTP (VLC, MPlayer), HTSP (Kodi, Movian) and SAT>IP
streaming.

The code is hosted at [github](https://github.com/tvheadend/tvheadend).
Please use github's features if you want to provide patches.
Contributions and improvements are always welcome.

## Before you Begin

There are some basic concepts that will make life much easier if you
understand them from the outset.

### Hardware/Software Fundamentals

* A **tuner** is the hardware (chipset) needed to interpret a digital
television signal and extract from it the programme stream. The tuner hardware
is also responsible for communicating with your satellite dish via the LNB
in the case of DVB-S.

* **Network tuners** are small (usually [arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) based)
computers that you connect to your network via Ethernet or Wifi, they often have a large number of tuners
and are controlled via a web interface or software. Many work out-of-the-box with Tvheadend using SAT>IP or the HDHomeRun protocols.

* A **driver** is the piece of software that your operating system uses to
talk to the tuner. This can be built into the OS (e.g. 'supported since kernel X')
or might be a separate piece of software that you need install, and maybe
even compile, separately.

* **Firmware** is a small piece of binary microcode that your system driver
sends to the tuner upon initialisation. This is the cause of more problems
than you'd imagine... if you find yourself in trouble, this is the first
thing to check along with kernel support for your hardware.

### Application/Tvheadend Fundamentals

The Tvheadend software then sets up a series of configuration elements, and
the way in which these interact determines how a TV signal ends up in front
of you. They all use what's known as a *many-to-many* relationship, in that
one configuration element can be related to multiple elements of the next
type, and vice versa: one tuner has multiple networks, one network can
exist on multiple tuners.

* The **network** is the software definition of your carrier network. Broadly,
it lays out what sort of network it is (such as DVB-T or DVB-S2), how it
gets scanned, where the DVB-S satellite is in orbit, and similar. Networks
are used by tuners so the hardware knows where to look for a signal.

* Networks then have **muxes**. These are the carrier frequencies that exist on
the old analogue channels that are used to transmit multiple digital signals
rather than a single analogue one. These signals are multiplexed together,
hence the name _mux_.

* Muxes then carry **services**. These are the individual streams of data.
They can be TV or radio programmes, they can provide data services such as
digital teletext, or they can be used as part of the control code for
catch-up IPTV services.

* And finally, services are mapped to **channels**. These are what you
and your client software think in terms of: _"I'd like to watch BBC One
now, please"_.

### Why the Complexity?

Simply, because 'BBC One' might exist in many different places... it
might have regional variations on multiple frequencies (so different services
on different muxes); it might exist on more than one source (perhaps on two
different satellites); and it might thus be accessible through more than one
piece of hardware (two satellite tuners, or one satellite and one terrestrial
tuner).

When you select the channel you want to watch or record, Tvheadend can
then map a path through all those variables to ask a particular tuner to
go and get the signal for you.

The following diagram explains the relationship between these components:

![Relationship Between Tuners, Neworks, Muxes, Services and Channels](static/img/doc/introduction/schematic.png)

---

## Using the Interface

Tvheadend is operated primarily through a tabbed web interface.

There are some basic navigation concepts that will help you get around and
make the best of it.

### Page Structure

The interface is made up of nested tabs, so similar functions are grouped
together (e.g. all configuration items at the top level, then all configuration
items for a particular topic are below that). Be aware that not all tabs are
shown by default, some are hidden depending on the current [view level](#view-level).

!["Tabs"](static/img/doc/introduction/tabbar.png)

Each tab is then laid out with a [menu bar](#menu-bar-panel-buttons) that provides access
to Add/Save/Edit-type functions, and a [grid](#grids) like a spreadsheet, a panel, or a list of (grouped) settings/options below that.

### Menu bar/Panel Buttons

!["Menubar"](static/img/doc/introduction/menubar.png)

Below is a (VERY) long list of the buttons you'll find in Tvheadend, 
They're listed here so you can quickly refer back to them at a later date (and know where to find them!).

!["Right Arrow"](static/img/doc/icons/arrow_right.png) (Next)  | Display/Jump to the next associated item, channel or EPG event.
!["Left Arrow"](static/img/doc/icons/arrow_left.png) (Previous)   | Display/Jump to the previous associated item, channel or EPG event.

Some of these buttons are only displayed in selected tabs/panels (noted in bold underneath).
For items not listed above, refer to the associated Help page.

### View Level

The *View level* drop-down/button - next to the Help button -
displays/hides the more advanced features. By default it is set to Basic.
Note, depending on [configuration](class/config) the view level drop-down isn't
always visible.

!["View level"](static/img/doc/introduction/viewlevel.png)

View level            | Description
----------------------|-------------------------------------------------
**Basic**             | Display the most commonly used tabs/items.
**Advanced**          | Display the more advanced tabs/items.
**Expert**            | Show all tabs/items.

### Grids

Most configuration items - certainly the ones that are common to all types
of item covered by that tab - are in this grid. 

However, some item-specific configuration items are then only available 
through the *Add* and *Edit* dialog boxes. For example, the main 
network configuration tab grid covers parameters common to 
DVB-S, -T, -C and IPTV networks, but specific things such as FEC 
rolloff or mux URL are then only in the dialogs for networks that need 
these values.

#### Displaying and Manipulating Columns

* Not all columns are necessarily visible. If you hover your mouse over a
  column heading, you'll see a down arrow - click here, and a drop-down menu
  will appear to give you access to **which columns are shown and which are not**.

* The same drop-down menu gives you access to a **sort** function if defined
  (it doesn't always make sense to have a sortable column for some parameters).
  You can also sort a column by simply clicking on the column header; reverse
  the sort order by clicking again.

* And the same drop-down menu also gives you access to a **filter** function
  if defined. The filter does simple pattern-matching on any string you
  provide. A small blue flag or triangle will appear in the top-left
  corner to indicate that a filter is active. Filters persist until
  cleared.

* **Re-arrange** the columns by simply dragging he header to a new spot.

* **Re-size** the columns by dragging the very edges of the column header as
  required.

!["Column options"](static/img/doc/introduction/columnoptions.png)

Note, a cookie is used to remember your column/filtering preferences; Clearing
your cookies will reset the interface to default.

### Split panels

The interface also makes use of split panels, examples 
being the *TV Adapters* and *EPG Grabber Modules* tabs. On the left, 
you'll see a list of items (or a tree as shown in the screenshot below), clicking 
on any of the items will display a parameter panel (on the right).

!["Split panel example"](static/img/doc/introduction/splitpanel.png)

When making changes (in the parameter panel) be sure to save **before** 
clicking on another item in the list.

### Paging Toolbar

The paging toolbar - at the bottom of most grids - offers many useful
tools.

!["Paging options"](static/img/doc/introduction/pagebar.png)

* General paging functions ```|< < > >|``` allow you to quickly move
between data sets.

* Lists the number of current and maximum (per page) rows displayed, followed by
the total number of items available.

* The *Per page* drop-down allows you to control how many rows are
displayed within the grid. By default, this is set to 50, increasing
the number of rows displayed may affect performance.

* The refresh icon allows you to refresh the currently-displayed rows.

* The *Auto refresh* check-box allows the interface to automatically
refresh the rows for you, every 30 seconds.

### Tvheadend log

The log contains information relating to the status of Tvheadend such 
as who's accessing it, what client they're using, and so on. it's mainly 
used for debugging (please see the debugging section for more), it can 
be used as a quick "is-it-working" overview too.

To open the log click the bar at the very bottom of the interface..

!["Log closed"](static/img/doc/introduction/logclosed.png)

The log will remain open for a few moments at a time, if you want to keep 
it open (or to close it), press the chevron ```▲``` (up) or ```▼``` 
(down) arrows. 

!["Log open"](static/img/doc/introduction/logopen.png)

The cog (or gear) ```⚙``` icon allows you to enable/disable a more 
verbose output.

### Adding, Editing and More

Menu bar buttons that display dialogs - certainly in the case of the 
Add and Edit buttons - show a dialog that share's a layout and buttons, 
these are explained in the table below.

Dialog button          | What it does
-----------------------|-------------------------
Cancel                 | Closes the dialog, discarding all unsaved changes.
Save                   | Saves (or add a new entry) & closes the dialog.
Apply                  | Saves pending changes but doesn't close the dialog, so you can more entries without having to fill in the fields again.
View Level             | Change the dialog view level to show/hide more advanced options.
Help                   | Display the help page.

Note, when using Save/Apply, certain fields must differ otherwise existing entries **may** be overwritten.

#### Adding/Editing

To add an entry, click the *Add* button - you should see a
dialog - you can now fill in the desired/required fields.
The entry can then be saved (*Create/Save* button), applied
(*Apply* button), or abandoned (*Cancel* button).
Note, you may need to make a pre-selection, for example, to pick a
network, a network type, or tuner.

To edit/delete etc, select the entry (or entries - see multi-select
below) and press the desired button.

#### Editing (in the Grid)

To edit a single entry, double click on the desired field/cell.
It should now be editable. Once you've made your changes you can then
save (*Save* button), or abandon (*Undo* button).
After a cell is changed, a small red flag or triangle will appear in
the top-left corner to indicate that it has been changed.
To change a check box or radio button, click once.

#### Multi-select

Rows (in the grid) are multi-selectable, so you can carry out certain
actions on more than one entry at a time. So, for example, you can select
multiple items by using ctrl+click, shift+click to select a range, or
ctrl+a to select all.
When dealing with multiple entries, an additional check-box will be
shown before each field in the dialog, remember to tick this
check-box so that the changes are applied to all (selected) entries.

!["Multi-select"](static/img/doc/introduction/multi-select.png)
