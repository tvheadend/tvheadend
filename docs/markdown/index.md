#Purpose

This document is intended to give you a high-level overview of how to set 
up Tvheadend for the first time. It does not aim to provide a complete description
of every step or answer every question: more details are available on the
tvheadend [wiki](https://tvheadend.org/projects/tvheadend/wiki).

As you set things up, consult the on-line (web interface) help as well.
Tvheadend includes copies of many of these pages in the application, which
is easier to find when you're wondering what to do next.

If you get really stuck, there's the [forum](https://tvheadend.org/projects/tvheadend/boards)
and IRC (*#hts* on *freenode*) - [Kiwi IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/?nick=tvhhelp|?#hts) or Freenode's [webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net) are good web
clients if you don't already have an IRC client installed.
