###Playing a Recording

You can play a recording by clicking the *Play* link, 
note that these links do not link to an actual file but to a playlist.

This will automatically launch an appropriate player, otherwise you will
need to manually open the playlist to start watching (normally a
double-click on the downloaded file).

###Downloading a Recording

Highlight the desired entry then press the *[Download]* button on the 
menu bar.

###Editing an Entry

You can edit an entry by clicking the *[Edit]* button on the menu bar, 
note that not all [Entry](class/dvrentry) fields can be edited.

###Deleting an Entry

Highlight the desired entry(s) then press the *[Delete]* button on the 
menu bar. 

**Deleting can't be undone. You 
will be prompted to confirm deletion.**

**Tip**: You can highlight multiple entries by holding ctrl or shift 
(to select a range) while clicking.
