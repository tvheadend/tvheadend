###Editing an Entry

There are two methods for editing an entry.

####Editing in the Grid

Highlight (select) the desired entry and then..:

* To edit a cell, double click on it. 
* To change a check box or radio button, click once.

After a cell is changed, a small red flag or triangle will appear in 
the top-left corner to indicate that it has been changed. These changes 
can now be kept (*[Save]* button), or abandoned (*[Undo]* button).

####Using the *[Edit]* Button

Highlight (select) the entries in the grid that you'd like to edit, then 
click the *[Edit]* button from the menu bar, the edit dialog should now 
be displayed. Note that when editing multiple 
entries there is an additional check box before each setting, 
ticking it will apply that setting to all selected entries.
After you've finished editing an entry you can save your pending changes 
using the *[Save]* button (closing the dialog), save your changes and continue making 
further adjustments by pressing the *[Apply]* button, or cancel any unsaved 
changes (and close the dialog) by pressing the *[Cancel]* button.
