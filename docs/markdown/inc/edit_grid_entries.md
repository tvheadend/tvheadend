###Editing an Entry

There are two methods to editing an entry.

<tvh_include>inc/selecting_entries_tip</tvh_include>

<tvh_include>inc/paging_tip</tvh_include>

####Editing in the Grid

Highlight (select) the desired entry and then..:

* To edit a cell, double click on it. 
* To change a check box or radio button, click once.

After a cell is changed, a small red flag or triangle will appear in 
the top-left corner to indicate that it has been changed. These changes 
can now be kept (*[Save]* button), or abandoned (*[Undo]* button).

####Using the *[Edit]* Button

Highlight (select) the entries in the grid that you'd like to edit, then 
click the *[Edit]* button from the menu bar, the edit dialog should now 
be displayed. A common set of fields is used for the edit dialog, most 
of which can be seen in the grid view. Note that when editing 
multiple entries there is an additional check box before each setting, 
ticking it will apply that setting to all selected entries.

Pressing the *[Save]* button (at the bottom of the dialog) 
will commit your changes and close the dialog, pressing the *[Apply]* 
button will commit your changes but won't close the dialog, pressing 
the *[Cancel]* button closes the dialog - any unsaved changes will be 
lost.
