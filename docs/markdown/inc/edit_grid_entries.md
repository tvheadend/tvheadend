###Editing an Entry

There are two methods to editing an entry.

**Tip**: You can select all entries within the grid by pressing ctrl+A. 
You can also ctrl+click to make additional selections, or shift+click to 
select a range. 

####Editing in the Grid

Highlight (select) the desired entry and then..:

* To edit a cell, double click on it. 
* To change a check box or radio button, click once.

After a cell is changed, a small red flag or triangle will appear in 
the top-left corner to indicate that it has been changed. These changes 
can now be kept (*[Save]* button), or abandoned (*[Undo]* button).

####Using the *[Edit]* Button

Highlight (select) the entries in the grid that you'd like to edit, then 
click the *[Edit]* button from the menu bar, the edit dialog should now 
be displayed. A common set of fields is used for the Edit dialog, most 
of which can also be seen in the grid view.

Pressing the *[Save]* button (at the bottom of the dialog) 
will commit your changes and close the dialog, pressing the *[Apply]* 
button will commit your changes but won't close the dialog, pressing 
the *[Cancel]* button closes the dialog - any unsaved changes will be 
lost.
