###Adding an Entry

To add an entry click the *[Add]* button from the menu bar, the add 
dialog should now be displayed. A common set of fields is used for the 
add dialog, most of which can be seen in the grid view.
Pressing the *[Save]* button (at the bottom of the dialog) 
will commit your changes and close the dialog, pressing the *[Apply]* 
button will commit your changes but won't close the dialog, pressing 
the *[Cancel]* button closes the dialog - any unsaved changes will be 
lost.
