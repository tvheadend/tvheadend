###Adding an Entry

To add an entry click the *[Add]* button from the menu bar, the add 
dialog should now be displayed. A common set of fields is used for the 
add dialog, most of which can be seen in the grid view.

You can save your entry by pressing the *[Save]* button, pressing the 
*[Apply]* button saves your entry but keeps the dialog open so you can 
make further adjustments, pressing the *[Cancel]* button closes the 
dialog - any unsaved changes will be lost.
