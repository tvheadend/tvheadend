###Adding an Entry

To add an entry click the *[Add]* button from the menu bar, the add 
dialog should now be displayed. A common set of fields is used for the 
add dialog, most of which can be seen in the grid view.

Once you're happy with what you've entered into the dialog you can save 
your entry using the *[Save]* button (closing the dialog), save your 
pending changes and continue making further adjustments by pressing the 
*[Apply]* button, or cancel any unsaved changes (and close the dialog) 
by pressing the *[Cancel]* button.
