###Playing a Stream/File

You can play a stream/file by copying/pasting the Play icon link from 
the grid into the desired player/software.

**Notes**:
* The links don't link to the actual stream but to a playlist for 
use with media players such as VLC, If you'd prefer to receive the raw 
stream instead, you can do so by removing the `/play/` path from 
the URL - see [URL Syntax](url) for more.
