### Playing a Stream/File

You can play a stream/file by clicking the play icon !['Play Icon Image'](static/icons/control_play.png).
This will automatically launch an appropriate player, otherwise you will
need to manually open the playlist to start watching (normally a
double-click on the downloaded file).

Note that the links don't link to the actual stream but to a playlist for 
use with media players such as VLC, If you'd prefer to receive the raw 
stream instead, you can do so by removing the `/play/` path from 
the URL - see [URL Syntax](url) for more info.
