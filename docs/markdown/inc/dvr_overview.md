## Overview

This tab is where you manage your recordings. Each entry is moved 
between the *Upcoming / Current Recordings*, *Finished Recordings* and 
*Failed Recordings* sub-tabs depending on status.

### Notes About the DVR

* Make sure you have enough tuners free to record (and watch) multiple 
services, insufficient tuners may result in missed recordings. However, 
depending on the tuner, most are able to receive a full multiplex, so 
you usually only need one per frequency/mux. You can quickly check if 
your tuner supports "full mux receive" by going to the *Muxes* tab and 
playing a freq/mux in something like VLC.

* If you're unsure as to why a scheduled recording failed, check the 
status column. Take a look at the *status* property [below](#items) for 
a list of possible reasons. 

* You can schedule a one-time only recording by pressing the [Add] 
button from the menu bar in the *Upcoming / Current Recordings* tab. 
You must enter a title, a start (and an end) time, and pick a channel.

* The time-based "Timers" tab allows you to schedule multiple recordings 
based on time and/or day.

* The *Auto-recording (Autorecs)* tab offers many powerful features, 
regular expressions for title, synopsis and description event matching, 
duplicate episode handling, time-frame based rules and much more!

* In the *Upcoming / Current Recordings* tab, duplicates are shown with 
a line-through.
