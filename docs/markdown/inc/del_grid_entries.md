###Deleting an Entry

Highlight (select) the desired entries in the grid, then press the *[Delete]* button on the 
menu bar. 

**Deleting can't be undone. You will be prompted to confirm. **

**Tip**: Rather than deleting an entry, you can disable it instead by 
unchecking the "Enabled" check box (if available).
