###Deleting an Entry

Highlight (select) the desired entries in the grid, then press the *[Delete]* button on the 
menu bar. 

**Deleting can't be undone. You will be prompted to confirm. **

**Tips**: 

* Rather than deleting an entry, you can disable it instead by 
unchecking the "Enabled" check box (if available).

* You can select all entries within the grid by pressing ctrl+A. 
You can also ctrl+click to make additional selections, or shift+click to 
select a range.
