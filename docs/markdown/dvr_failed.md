###Playing a Failed Recording

You can play a partial recording by clicking the *Play* link, 
note that these links do not link to an actual file but to a playlist.

This will automatically launch an appropriate player, otherwise you will
need to manually open the playlist to start watching (normally a
double-click on the downloaded file).

###Downloading a Recording

Highlight the desired entry then press the *[Download]* button on the menu bar.

###Re-recording an Entry/Re-schedule a Failed Recording

You can re-schedule an entry by pressing the *[Re-record]* button on the menu bar.

**Note**: Your EPG data must have another matching event to be able to re-schedule 
the entry.

###Moving an Entry

Failed recordings can be moved to the [Finished Recordings](dvr_finished) 
tab by highlighting the desired entry and then pressing the *[Move to finished]*
button from the menu bar.

###Deleting an Entry

Highlight the desired entry(s) then press the *[Delete]* button on the menu bar. 

**Deleting can't be undone. You will be prompted to confirm deletion.**

**Tip**: You can highlight multiple entries by holding ctrl or shift 
(to select a range) while clicking.
