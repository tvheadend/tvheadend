## Install Tvheadend

This section tells you how to get hold of the software in the first place,
and how to get it onto your system.

Follow the instructions that are specific to your Linux distribution
(Ubuntu/Debian/Mint, Arch, Fedora...). This will typically be PPA-and-dpkg
for Debian, but most other distros will need you to build your own version from source.

Do not assume that your distro's package manager will give you the latest
version of Tvheadend - indeed, give you any version at all. Always check.

Where a pre-built package exists, this will usually get you the last official
stable version. However, more advanced users may be interested in running
a development version - either a nightly build or a self-compiled version.
