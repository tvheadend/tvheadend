## Updating the Documentation 

The documentation is written in markdown, and then converted for
direct inclusion to tvheadend binary. The markdown processor in
Tvheadend binary adds other information from the internal
class system.

### Instructions For Built-in Help

Change markdown files in `docs/markdown`, `docs/markdown/inc`, `docs/class`, `docs/wizard`, etc.
Images are placed in `src/webui/static/img/doc/`.

Build Tvheadend as you normally would, see the [README](README.md) for details.
