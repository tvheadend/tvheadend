###1. Adding an Entry/Adding a New Recording

You can add an entry by:

####1.1. Using the EPG

Using the Electronic Program Guide search functionality, find the 
program/event you would like to record. For full instructions on how to 
search the EPG, take a look at the [EPG](epg) page.

Once you've found the program you'd like to record, click on it, then 
using the resultant dialog you can:

* Record it once by pressing the *[Record program]* button.
* Automatically record all upcoming events matching the program's title by pressing the *[Autorec]* button.
* Record all upcoming series episodes by pressing the *[Record series]* button. **This replaces the *[Autorec]* button when series link information is available.**
  
**Tip**: You can quickly find all matching programs by clicking on the title.

####1.2. Using Autorec Rules

Autorec rules allow you to match events using various options. 

* Record events using regular expressions, they can be as simple or as powerful as you like.
* Record events that broadcast between certain times or days of the week.

Please see [Autorec](dvr_autorec) for more information.

###1.3. Manual Event Entry/Editing an Entry

A common set of fields is used for the _Add_ or _Edit_ functions, most
of which can also be seen in the grid view:
