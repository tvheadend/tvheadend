<p><strong>Title</strong> : The title (name) of the recording. While this is copied from the EPG when you create a recording, it’s not used to match the event itself and is thus used here as the name of the event (see also: adding an event manually with the <strong>Add</strong> button).</p>
<p><strong>Subtitle</strong> : <font color=red>Text...</font></p>
<p><strong>Episode</strong> : The episode number of the recording (whether this is available depends on your broadcaster and/or EPG data source).</p>
<p><strong>Priority</strong> : The priority of the recording: Not set, Important, High, Normal, Low, Unimportant. If there is a clash, more important recordings will take priority over less important ones.</p>
<p><strong>Scheduled Start Time</strong> :The date and time when the scheduled recording will start. Note that this includes any extra time defined in the recording profile (e.g. “start two minutes earlier than the EPG start time”).</p>
<p><strong>Scheduled Stop Time</strong> : The date and time when the scheduled recording will stop. Note that this includes any extra time defined in the recording profile (e.g. “finish recording five minutes after the EPG stop time”).</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> : The total duration of the scheduled recording, including any extra time before or after.</p>
<p><strong>File Size</strong> : <font color=red>Text...</font></p>
<p><strong>Channel</strong> : The channel to be recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Owner</strong> : <font color=red>Text...</font></p>
