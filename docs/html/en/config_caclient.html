<h3>Configuration - CAs</h3>
<p>Tvheadend support connecting to card clients via the cwc (newcamd) and capmt (dvbapi) protocols for so-called 'softcam' descrambling.</p>

<h5>Grid Items</h5>
<p>The main grid items have the following functions:</p>
<p><strong>Enabled</strong> : If selected, connection will be tried to be established and retained up. If unselected, Tvheadend will disconnect (if connected) and not try to reconnect.</p>
<p><strong>Hostname</strong> : Server hostname. DNS lookup is performed upon every connection attempt.</p>
<p><strong>Port</strong> : Server TCP port</p>
<p><strong>Username</strong> : Username to use.</p>
<p><strong>Password</strong> : Password to use.</p>
<p><strong>DES Key</strong> : Initial DES key.</p>
<p><strong>Update Card</strong> : Forward Entitlement Management Messages (EMMs) to the server.</p>
<p><strong>Update One</strong> : Forward EMMs only from one channel at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong> : Allows the administrator to set a comment only visible in this editor. It does not serve any active purpose.</p>

<p>The columns have the following functions:</p>
<p><strong>Enabled</strong> : If selected, connection will be tried to be established and retained up. If unselected, Tvheadend will disconnect (if connected) and not try to reconnect.</p>
<p><strong>Camd.socket Filename / IP Address</strong> : Socket filename which is usually opened by cam client. Tvheadend tries to connect to this socket file.</p>
<p>In mode 3 (TCP), enter the IP address of the oscam server. Tvheadend tries to create a TCP connecting to this IP adress and <em>Connect port</em> .</p>
<p><strong>Listen / Connect port</strong> : If running on a so called full-featured DVB-Card this can be left empty. Running on Budget-Cards one has to use a dummy ca-device. This is emulated via capmt_ca.so. This module has to be pre-loaded prior to the cam client.</p>
<p><em>LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/capmt_ca.so cam_client &</em></p>
<p>This module will communicate the received control-words back to Tvheadend via Port 9000</p>
<p>In mode 3 (TCP), this port is used for the oscam connection. It must be equal to the listen port in the oscam/dvbapi settings.</p>
<p><strong>OSCam mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mode 0 (LD_PRELOAD)</strong> : LD_PRELOAD hack is active</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>mode 1 (old OSCam)</strong> : If selected, connection will be made directly to oscam without using LD_PRELOAD hack. Port 9000 will be used automatically.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>mode 2 (new OSCam since revision 9095)</strong> : In this mode, no UDP connections are required. All communication is processed though the Camd.socket. The configuration for OSCam should be same as for mode 1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>mode 3 (new OSCam since revision 9574)</strong> : A TCP connection to server is created. All emm/ecm data are send to oscam using this connection without a requirement for the real linuxdvb devices in the system with OSCam. This mode is suitable for all DVB devices including SAT>IP and IPTV.</li>
