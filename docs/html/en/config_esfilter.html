<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Elementary Stream Filters</p>
<p>This section applies to the filters for <strong>Video</strong>,
<strong>Audio</strong>, <strong>Teletext</strong>, <strong>Subtitle</strong>,
<strong>CA</strong> and <strong>Other</strong>.</p>
</div>  

<p>This table defines rules to filter and order the elementary streams (PIDs) like video or audio from the input feed. The execution order of commands is granted. It means that first rule is executed for all available streams then second and so on.</p>
<h3>NOTE: <font color=red>SCREENSHOT HERE</font></h3>
<p>If any elementary stream is not marked as ignored or exclusive, it is used. If you like to ignore unknown elementary streams, add a rule to the end of grid with the any (not defined) comparisons and with the action ignore.</p>
<p>The rules for different elementary stream groups (video, audio, teletext, subtitle, CA, other) are executed separately (as visually edited).</p>
<p>For the visual verification of the filtering, there is a service info dialog in the Configuration / DVB Inputs / Services window . This dialog shows the received PIDs and filtered PIDs in one window.</p>

<h5>Grid Items</h5>
<p>The main grid items have the following functions:</p>
<p><strong>Class</strong> : : <font color=red>Text...</font></p>
<p><strong>Index</strong> : <font color=red>Text...</font></p>
<p><strong>Enabled</strong> : If selected, the rule will be enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Stream Type</strong> : Select the elementary stream type to compare. Empty field means any.</p>
<p><strong>Language</strong> : Select the language to compare. Empty field means any. <em>Not applicable to CA filters</em> .</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong> : The service to compare. Empty field means any.</p>
<p><strong>CA Identification</strong> : The CAID to compare. Empty field means any. <em>Applicable only to CA filters</em> .</p>
<p><strong>CA Provider</strong> : The CA provider to compare. Empty field means any. <em>Applicable only to CA filters</em> .</p>
<p><strong>Stream Index</strong> : The logical stream index to compare. Note that this index is computed using all filters.</p>
<blockquote><p>Example: If filter is set to AC3 audio type and the language to ‘eng’ and there are two AC3 ‘eng’ streams in the service, the first stream could be identified using number 1 and the second using number 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PID</strong> : Program identification (PID) number to compare. Zero means any. This comparison is processed only when service comparison is active and for the Conditional Access filter.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong> : The rule action defines the operation when all comparisons succeeds.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NONE</strong> : No action, may be used for the logging and a comparison verification.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>USE</strong> : Use this elementary stream.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>ONE_TIME</strong> : Use this elementary stream only one time per service type (like video, audio, subtitles) and language. The first sucessfully compared rule wins. For example, when one AC3 elementary stream is marked to be used with ‘eng’ language and another rule with the ONE_TIME action was matched, the new AC3 elementary stream will not be added if the language for new AC3 elementary stream is ‘eng’. Note that the second rule might not have the language filter (column) set. For the CA filter, this rule means that the new CA elementary stream is added only if another CA is not already used.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>EXCLUSIVE</strong> : Use only this elementary stream. No other elementary streams will be used.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>EMPTY</strong> : Add this elementary stream only when no elementary streams are used from previous rules.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>IGNORE</strong> : Ignore this elementary stream. This stream is not used. Another successfully compared rule with different action may override it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Log</strong> : Write a short message to log identifying the matched parameters. It is useful for debugging your setup or structure of incoming streams.</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong> : Free-format text comment. Not used otherwise.</p>
