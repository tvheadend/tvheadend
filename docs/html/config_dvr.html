  <dt>DVR Log retention time (days)
  <dd>Time that Tvheadend will keep information about the recording in its internal database. Notice that the actual recorded file will not be deleted when the log entry is deleted.

  <dt>Extra time before recordings (minutes)
  <dd>Specify the number of minutes to record before the events scheduled start time. Used to cope with small scheduling errors.

  <dt>Extra time after recordings (minutes)
  <dd>Specify the number of minutes to record after the events scheduled stop time. Used to cope with small scheduling errors.

  <dt>Post-processor command
  <dd>Command to run after finishing a recording. The command will be run in background and is executed even if a recording is aborted or an error occurred. Use the %e error formatting string to check for errors, the error string is empty if recording finished successfully.

      Example usage: /path/to/ffmpeg -i %f -vcodec libx264 -acodec copy "/path/with white space/%b"<br>
      You need to use quotes or escape white spaces if you want white spaces in an argument.

  <dt>Recording system path
  <dd>Path to where Tvheadend will write recorded events. If components of the path does not exist, Tvheadend will try to create them.
 
  <dt>File permissions for recordings (3-byte octal)
  <dd>The permissions to be set on the resultant recording files. This is useful if you need to manipulate the files after recording under a different user ID, e.g. to chop out commercials.
      
      <table class="hts-doc-text" border="0">
      <tr><td>Common examples:</td></tr>

	  See also <i>Directory permissions for recordings</i> in <i>Subdirectory Options</i>. 
	  
  <dt>Rewrite PAT in passthrough mode
  <dd>Rewrite the original Program Association Table to only include the active service.  When this option is disabled, Tvheadend will write the original PAT as broadcast, which lists all services from the original multiplex.

  <dt>Rewrite PMT in passthrough mode
  <dd>Generate a Program Map Table only listing the streams actually in the output transport stream.  When this option is disabled, Tvheadend will write the original Program Map Table as broadcast, which may include references to excluded streams such as data and ECMs.

  <dt>Tag files with metadata
  <dd>If checked, media containers that support metadata will be tagged with the metadata associated with the event being recorded.

  <dt>Skip commercials
  <dd>If checked, commercials will be dropped from the recordings. At the moment, commercial detection only works for the swedish channel TV4.

  <dt>Directory permissions for recordings (3-byte octal)
