		A network is the type of carrier for your television signals. Tvheadend supports several different types of network, notably:
		<dl>
		<li><b>DVB-C</b> : Cable TV, delivered via a cable to your house
		<li><b>DVB-S</b> : Satellite (includes S2), so any signal coming in via a dish
		<li><b>DVB-T</b> : Terrestrial, so over-the-air broadcasts received through a traditional television aerial
		<li><b>ATSC</b> : Over-the-air terrestrial, common in north and central America and parts of south Asia
		<li><b>IPTV</b> : IP, so over the Internet
		</dl>

<b>Buttons</b>
<hr>
Buttons have the following functions:
<br><br>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Add</b>
  <dd>
  Add a new network. You can choose from any of the types described above.
  <p>
  <dt><b>Delete</b>
  <dd>
  Delete an existing network. This will also remove any association with an adapter.
  <p>
  <dt><b>Edit</b>
  <dd>
  Edit an existing network. This allows you to change any of the parameters you'd otherwise set when adding a new network, e.g. network discovery, idle scan, etc. - similar to using the check boxes to enable/disable functions.
  <p>
  <dt><b>Save</b>
  <dd>
  Saves any changes.
  <p>
  <dt><b>Undo</b>
  <dd>
  Undoes any changes.
  <p>
  </dl>

	<hr>
	<b>Columns</b>
	<hr>
 	The columns have the following functions:

 	<dl>
  		<dt><b>Network Name</b>
		<dd>The name of the network. This can be set automatically or you can give it a name that means something to you (e.g. if you have multiple OTA networks).
		<p>	
		<dt><b>Network Discovery</b>
		<dd>Whether automatic discovery is enabled for this network, i.e. whether Tvheadend looks for muxes or simply stays with the list of muxes as defined initially.
<p>
		<dt><b>Skip initial Scan</b>
		<dd>Don't scan this network for muxes at Tvheadend start.
<p>
		<dt><b>Idle Scan Muxes</b>
		<dd>When nothing else happens Tvheadend will continuously rotate among all muxes and tune to them to verify that they are still working. If your adapter have problems with lots of tuning, try to disable this.
<p>
		<dt><b>Ignore Provider's Channel Numbers</b>
		<dd>Some providers will try to set a channel number so that every receiver is consistent - "tune to Channel x on 150". This option allows you to ignore this and let tvhheadend allocate a channel number itself.
<p>
		<dt><b>Max Input Streams</b>
		<dd>IPTV : maximum simultaneous streams that can be played.
<p>
		<dt><b>Max Bandwidth</b>
		<dd>IPTV : maximum bandwidth allowed for streams. 
<p>
		<dt><b>Max timeout</b>
		<dd>IPTV : maximum timeout trying to play stream.
<p>
		<dt><b>Network ID</b>
		<dd>If you experience problems caused by overlaps between multiple network
  providers this option can be used to filter which network ID is received
  by a given adapter.
<p>
		<dt><b>Character Set</b>
		<dd>The character encoding for this network (e.g. UTF-8).
<p>
		<dt><b>Priority</b>
		<dd>IPTV : The network priority value (higher value = higher priority to use muxes/services from this network).
<p>
		<dt><b>Streaming Priority</b>
		<dd>IPTV : The network priority value for streamed channels through HTTP or HTSP (higher value = higher priority to use muxes/services from this
                    network). If not set, the standard network priority value is used.
