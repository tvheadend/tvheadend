<div class="hts-doc-text">

This table defines rules to filter and order the elementary streams
like video or audio from the input feed.

<p>
The execution order of commands is granted. It means that first rule
is executed for all available streams then second and so on.

<p>
If any elementary stream is not marked as ignored or exclusive, it is
used. If you like to ignore unknown elementary streams, add a rule
to the end of grid with the any (not defined) comparisons and
with the action ignore.

<p>
The rules for different elementary stream groups (video, audio,
teletext, subtitle, CA, other) are executed separately (as visually edited).

<p>
For the visual verification of the filtering, there is a service info
dialog in the Configuration / DVB Inputs / Services window . This dialog
shows the received PIDs and filtered PIDs in one window.

<p>
The rules are listed / edited  in a grid.

<ul>
  <li>To edit a cell, double click on it. After a cell is changed it
      will flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
      changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the
      'Save changes' button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only
      have to click once in it.

  <li>To add a new entry, press the 'Add entry' button. The new (empty) entry
      will be created on the server but will not be in its enabled state.
      You can now change all the cells to the desired values, check the
      'enable' box and then press 'Save changes' to activate the new entry.

  <li>To delete one or more entries, select the lines (by clicking once on
      them), and press the 'Delete selected' button. A pop up
      will ask you to confirm your request.

  <li>To move up or down one or more entries, select the lines (by clicking
      once on  them), and press the 'Move up' or 'Move down' button.
</ul>

<p>
The columns have the following functions:

<dl>
  <dt>Enabled
  <dd>If selected, the rule will be enabled.

  <dt>Stream Type
  <dd>Select the elementary stream type to compare. Empty field means any.

  <dt>Language
  <dd>Select the language to compare. Empty field means any.

  <dt>Service
  <dd>The service to compare. Empty field means any.

  <dt>CA Identification
  <dd>The CAID to compare. Empty field means any.

  <dt>CA Provider
  <dd>The CA provider to compare. Empty field means any.

  <dt>Stream Index
  <dd>The logical stream index to compare. Note that this index is computed
      using all filters. Example: If filter is set to AC3 audio type and
      the language to 'eng' and there are two AC3 'eng' streams in
      the service, the first stream could be identified using number 1
      and the second using number 2.

  <dt>PID
  <dd>Program identification (PID) number to compare. Zero means any.
      This comparison is processed only when service comparison is active
      and for the Conditional Access filter.

  <dt>Action
  <dd>The rule action defines the operation when all comparisons succeeds.

    <dl>

      <dt>NONE
      <dd>No action, may be used for the logging and a comparison verification.

      <dt>USE
      <dd>Use this elementary stream.

      <dt>ONCE
      <dd>Use this elementary stream only once per service type.
          The language is distinguished, too.
          The first successfully compared rule wins.

      <dt>EXCLUSIVE
      <dd>Use only this elementary stream. No other elementary streams
          will be used.

      <dt>EMPTY
      <dd>Add this elementary stream only when no elementary streams are
          used from previous rules.

      <dt>IGNORE
      <dd>Ignore this elementary stream. This stream is not used. Another
          successfully compared rule with different action may override it.

    </dl>

  <dt>Log
  <dd>Write a short message to log identifying the matched parameters.
      It is useful for debugging your setup or structure of incoming
      streams.
