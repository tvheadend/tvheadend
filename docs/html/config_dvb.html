<dl>
 <dt>General tab</dt>
  The general tab contains information and some per-adapter global
  configuration.

 <dl>
  <dt>Add DVB Network by location...
  <dd>
  Pressing this button will popup a window that allows the user to select
  a DVB network based on location. The adapter will be populated with
  multiplexes from these networks and immediately start to scan for services.

  <dt>Map DVB services to channels...
  <dd>
  Pressing this button will start a process that scans all services on all
  multiplexes and tries to verify if the service is actually a working
  TV channel. If so, the channel will be created and mapped to this service.
  You can start mapping services to channels once all muxes have been 
  processed. Until then the option will be disabled.

  <dt>Adapter name
  <dd>
  You can change the display name for the adapter.

  <dt>Autodetect muxes
  <dd>
  The DVB transmissions contains information about other muxes available
  on the same network. If this checkbox is enabled, Tvheadend will 
  automatically create new muxes as it receives configuration for them
  via the DVB networks.

  <dt>Idle scanning
  <dd>
  When nothing else happens Tvheadend will continuously rotate among all
  muxes and tune to them to verify that they are still working. 
  If your adapter have problems with lots of tuning, try to disable this.

  <dt>Detailed logging
  <dd>
  If this is enabled, Tvheadend will log more information related to
  this specific adapter. You might wanna enable this if you have some
  kind of issues in order to better diagnose the problems.

<dl>
 <dt>Multiplexes tab</dt>
 All multiplexes on the currently selected adapter are listed and can be
 edited in a grid. 

 <ul>
  <li>To edit a cell, double-click on it. After a cell is changed it
      will flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
      changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the 
      'Save changes' button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only
      have to click once in it.

  <li>To delete one or more entries, select the lines (by clicking once on 
      them), and press the 'Delete selected' button. A popup
      will ask you to confirm your request. Note, that if you have 
      automatic mux discovery enabled the mux will probably come back
      quite soon.
 </ul>

 The columns have the following functions:

 <dl>
  <dt>Enabled
  <dd>Uncheck this if a multiplex is of no interest to you or otherwise
      temporary broken

  <dt>Network
  <dd>Network name as given in the DVB stream. Can not be changed

  <dt>Frequency
  <dd>Center frequency for the mux. Can not be changed

  <dt>Modulation
  <dd>Information about the modulation used on the mux. Can not be changed

  <dt>Mux id
  <dd>Unique ID for this mux in the dvb network. Can not be changed

  <dt>Quality
  <dd>Tvheadend's estimated quality for the mux.
 </dl>
</dl>

<dl>
 <dt>Services tab</dt>
 All services on the currently selected adapter are listed and can be
 edited in a grid. 

 <ul>
  <li>To edit a cell, double-click on it. After a cell is changed it
      will flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
      changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the 
      'Save changes' button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only
      have to click once in it.

  <li>Service can not be deleted since they are directly inherited /
      discovered from a mux they will reappear in just a few seconds
      should one delete them.
 </ul>

 <p>
 The columns have the following functions:

 <dl>
  <dt>Enabled
  <dd>Uncheck this if a service is of no interest to you or otherwise
      temporary broken

  <dt>Service name
  <dd>Service name as given in the DVB stream. Can not be changed

  <dt>Channel name
  <dd>Double-click on this column to map the service to a channel.

  <dt>DVB default charset
  <dd>
  According to "ETSI EN 300 468", the default character set for EIT data is
  ISO6937. Unfortunately, some broadcasters actually use ISO-8859-x encodings
  but fail to correctly announce it. To fix this you can set the default 
  charset to use when none is specified by the broadcaster.

  <dt>EIT
  <dd>Uncheck this if EIT data should not be retreived for this service.

  <dt>Type
  <dd>Type of service. Can not be changed

  <dt>Provider
  <dd>Provider as given in the DVB stream. Can not be changed

  <dt>Network
  <dd>Network name for the mux this service resides on

  <dt>Multiplex

 <p>
 A word about DVB adapters
 <p>
 A DVB adapter represents a piece of hardware attached to the system.
 DVB receivers with dual tuners will present themselves as two adapters
 to the Tvheadend application. Tvheadend support DVB-T, DVB-C and DVB-S
 adapters.
 <p>
 There is currently no way of adding a new adapter to Tvheadend when running.
 If a new adapter is plugged into the system Tvheadend needs to be restarted
 in order to detect it.
 <p>
 If Tvheadend has configuration for an adapter and the adapter is missing
 upon start-up the configuration will be left untouched in case the adapter
 will be back in the future. There is currently no way to remove configuration
 for a no longer present adapter.
 <p>
 Warning: Unplugging an DVB adapter (USB, etc) during operation (i.e when
 Tvheadend is running) can result in deadlocking the kernel USB subsystem,
 most likely requiring a system restart.
 <p>
 Warning2: Suspending a system is (from a USB driver perspective) equivalent
 to a unplug/insert event. Thus, suspending a system running Tvheadend
 with USB adapters is not recommended at the moment.
