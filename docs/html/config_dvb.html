<dl>
 <dt>General tab</dt>
  The general tab contains information and some per-adapter global
  configuration.

 <dl>
  <dt>Add DVB Network by location...
  <dd>
  Pressing this button will popup a window that allows the user to select
  a DVB network based on location. The adapter will be populated with
  multiplexes from these networks and immediately start to scan for services.

  <dt>Map DVB services to channels...
  <dd>
  Pressing this button will start a process that scans all services on all
  multiplexes and tries to verify if the service is actually a working
  TV channel. If so, the channel will be created and mapped to this service.
  You can start mapping services to channels once all muxes have been 
  processed. Until then the option will be disabled.

  <dt>Adapter name
  <dd>
  You can change the display name for the adapter. This is highly recommended
  for multi-adapter setups with adapters that report the same name to avoid
  confusion.

  <dt>Autodetect muxes
  <dd>
  The DVB transmissions contains information about other muxes available
  on the same network. If this checkbox is enabled, Tvheadend will 
  automatically create new muxes as it receives configuration for them
  via the DVB networks.
  
  <dt>Skip initial scan
  <dd>
  By default Tvheadend will rescan all muxes before more detailed background
  scanning (including EPG scans) can be properly started. This is to verify
  all muxes are still valid.
  <br/>
  This will not stop the ability to watch live TV, however for most setups
  this option can be checked.

  <dt>Idle scanning
  <dd>
  When nothing else happens Tvheadend will continuously rotate among all
  muxes and tune to them to verify that they are still working. 
  If your adapter have problems with lots of tuning, try to disable this.

  <dt>Close device handle when idle
  <dd>
  This will attempt to close all available device handles. This can be 
  necessary to allow some devices to go into low power states.
  <br/>
  However this option has been known to cause problems with some multi tuner
  DVB cards. If you have signal problems, try disabling this option.
  <br/>
  Note: this option has no effect if idle scanning is enabled.

  <dt>Skip service availability check when mapping
  <dd>
  By default Tvheadend will validate that a service can be correctly 
  received (including any descrambling) when mapping channels. You can disable
  this checking by enabling this option.

  <dt>Use SID as channel number during mapping
  <dd>
  If you enable this option then the initial mapping of channels will use
  the service ID as the channel number, should no local channel number be
  provided in the service information tables.
    
  <dt>Monitor signal quality
  <dd>
  If you enable this option Tvheadend will attempt to monitor signal quality
  of a mux using an internal metric. If the calculated quality falls to low
  the mux/adapter will generally be ignored.

  <dt>Disable PMT monitoring
  <dd>
  This disable monitoring Program Map Table (PMT) for all services on a mux.
  <br/>
  Most people should not require this, but because this involves creating a
  lot of table filters, some DVB cards have problems and report errors related
  to too many open file descriptors. If this happens try enabling this option.

  <dt>Write full DVB MUX to disk
  <dd>
  If this is enabled, Tvheadend will store the full mux stream to disk for
  debugging and development purposes. Don't enable this unless you know what
  you're doing.
  
  <dt>Original Network ID
  <dd>
  If you experience problems caused by overlaps between multiple network
  providers this option can be used to filter which network ID is received
  by a given adapter.
  
  <dt>Extra priority
  <dd>
  This field can be used to define a priority ordering for adapters. This will
  be used when determining which adapter to use to service a subscription
  request. It could be used for example to prefer a DVB-S adapter over a 
  DVB-T one.

  <dt>DiSEqC version (DVB-S only)
  <dd>
  If you're using a DiSEqC switch, then specify the version here.
 
  <dt>Turn off LNB when idle
  <dd>
  This option can be enabled to disable the power to the LNB when the adapter
  is not in use. This can reduce power consumption, however for poorly shieled
  multi tuner setups you may some inteference when the LNB is re-enabled.

<dl>
 <dt>Multiplexes tab</dt>
 All multiplexes on the currently selected adapter are listed and can be
 edited in a grid. 

 <ul>
  <li>To edit a cell, double-click on it. After a cell is changed it
      will flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
      changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the 
      'Save changes' button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only
      have to click once in it.

  <li>To delete one or more entries, select the lines (by clicking once on 
      them), and press the 'Delete selected' button. A popup
      will ask you to confirm your request. Note, that if you have 
      automatic mux discovery enabled the mux will probably come back
      quite soon.
 </ul>

 The columns have the following functions:

 <dl>
  <dt>Enabled

      temporary broken

      have to click once in it.

  <li>Service can not be deleted since they are directly inherited /

 <h2>A word about DVB adapters</h2>
 <p>
 A DVB adapter represents a piece of hardware attached to the system.
 DVB receivers with dual tuners will present themselves as two adapters
 to the Tvheadend application. Tvheadend support DVB-T, DVB-C and DVB-S
 adapters.
 <p>
 There is currently no way of adding a new adapter to Tvheadend when running.
 If a new adapter is plugged into the system Tvheadend needs to be restarted
 in order to detect it.
 <p>
 If Tvheadend has configuration for an adapter and the adapter is missing
 upon start-up the configuration will be left untouched in case the adapter
 will be back in the future. There is currently no way to remove configuration
 for a no longer present adapter.
 <p>
 Warning: Unplugging an DVB adapter (USB, etc) during operation (i.e when
 Tvheadend is running) can result in deadlocking the kernel USB subsystem,
 most likely requiring a system restart.
 <p>
 Warning2: Suspending a system is (from a USB driver perspective) equivalent
 to a unplug/insert event. Thus, suspending a system running Tvheadend
 with USB adapters is not recommended at the moment.
