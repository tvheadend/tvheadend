 <p>
 This tabs allow configuration of several general parameters that affect the
 core TVH functionality.
 </p>

 <dl>
	   
  <br><br>
  <hr>
  <b>Language Settings</b>
  <hr>
  
  <dt>Default Language(s)
  <dd>
  Select the list of languages (in order of priority) to be used for supplying
  EPG information to clients that don't provide their own configuration.</dd>
  <p>
  <dd>The EPG information is NOT translated, this only applies to EPG providers
  that give information (titles, descriptions, etc..) in multiple languages.</dd>
  
  <br><br>
  <hr>
  <b>DVB Scan Files</b>
  <hr>
  
  <dt>DVB scan files path:
  <dd>
  Select the path to use for DVB scan configuration files. Typically
  dvb-apps stores these in /usr/share/dvb/. Leave blank to use TVH's internal
  file set.</dd>

  <br><br>
  <hr>
  <b>Time Update</b>
  <hr>

  <dd>Tvheadend has a built-in capability to update the system time.
  However, you should bear in mind that DVB time is not highly accurate and is
  prone to both jitter and variation between different transponders.</dd>
  <br>
  <dd>Where possible, it's probably still better to use an internet based NTP source
  to synchronise the system clock (i.e. through the underlying operating system).</dd>

  <dl>
    <dt>Update time</dt>
    <dd>Enable system time updates. This will only work if the user
    running TVH has rights to update the system clock (normally only root).</dd>
 
    <dt>Enable NTP driver</dt>
    <dd>This will create an NTP driver (using shmem interface) that you can feed
    into ntpd. This can be run without root priviledges, but generally the 
    performance is not that great.</dd>
  
    <dt>Update tolerance (milliseconds)</dt>
    <dd>Only update the system clock (doesn't affect NTP driver) if the delta
    between the system clock and DVB time is greater than this. This can help
    stop excessive oscillations on the system clock.</dd>

   <br><br>
   <hr>
   <b>Picon</b>
   <hr>

   <dd>Picons (from p ersonal icons) are collections of similar icons that can be automatically
   matched against your channels based on a number of technical parameters that will uniquely 
   define a channel. The use of these parameters (e.g. mux, frequency, orbital position) 
   removes the ambiguity of using names - it's not case sensitive, it doesn't care if there 
   are spaces or not, and so on.

   You can generate picons yourself from existing images, or you can usually find sets 
   pre-made on the Internet if you search for them. They're a good way to get large numbers 
   of icons matched quickly, and usually in a similar style (such as square, x * y pixels, with 
   a consistent highlight/reflection effect).</dd>

   <dl>
    <dt>Prefer picons over channel name:</dt>
    <dd>If both a picon and a channel-specific (e.g. channelname.jpg) icon are defined, use the picon.</dd>
 
    <dt>Channel icon path</dt>
    <dd>Path to an icon for this channel. This can be named however you wish, as a local (file://) or remote (http://) image. 
        The following placeholders are available:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>%C - the transliterated channel name in ASCII (safe characters, no spaces etc.)</li>
		<li>%c - the channel name (URL encoded ASCII)</li>
	</ul>
	Example: file:///tmp/icons/%C.png or http://example.com/%c.png</dd>
  
    <dt>Picon path</dt>
    <dd>Path to a directory (folder) containing your picon collection. This can be named however 
    you wish, as a local (file://) or remote (http://) location - however, remember that it's pointing 
    to a directory as the picon names are automatically generated from the service parameters 
    frequency, orbital position, etc.).<br>
    Example: file:///home/hts/picons</dd>
  </dl>
  
  <br><br>
  <hr>
  <b>Image Caching</b>
  <hr>

  <dd>This will cache any channel icons or other images (such as
  EPG metadata) to be served from the local webserver. This
  can be useful for multi-client systems and, generally, to reduce hits on
  upstream providers.</dd>

  <dl>

  <dt>Enabled
  <dd>
  Select whether or not to enable caching. Note: even with this disabled
  you can still specify local (file://) icons and these will be served by
  the built-in webserver.
  
  <dt>Re-fetch period (hours)
  <dd>
  How frequently the upstream provider is checked for changes.
  
  <dt>Re-try period (hours)
  <dd>
  How frequently it will re-try fetching an image that has failed to be
  fetched.

  <dt>Ignore invalid SSL certificates
  <dd>Ignore invalid/unverifiable (expired, self-certified, etc.) certificates
