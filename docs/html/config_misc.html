 <p>
 This tabs allow configuration of several general parameters that affect the
 core TVH functionality.
 </p>

 <dl>
  <dt>Default Language(s)
  <dd>
  Select the list of languages (in order of priority) to be used for supplying
  EPG information to clients that don't provide their own configuration.
  <p>
  The EPG information is NOT translated, this only applies to EPG providers
  that give information (titles, descriptions, etc..) in multiple languages.

  <dt>DVB scan files path:
  <dd>
  Select the path to use for DVB scan configuration files. Typically
  dvb-apps stores these in /usr/share/dvb/. Leave blank to use TVH's internal
  file set.

  <dt>Cache channel icons:
  <dd>
  Enable the caching of channel icons. This will cause TVH to download channel
  icons locally, and then when requested via HTSP clients the URL for the icon
  (or logo) will be retrieved from the TVH web server rather than fetched each
  time by the HTSP client.
  This REQUIRES the TVH server IP address field to also be populated

  <dt>TVH Server IP Address:
  <dd>
  Enter the IP address of the TVH server used for HTSP clients. This permits the
  above cache channel icons to work (TVH Clients are directed to the IP address
  entered here to retrieve channel icons from)
