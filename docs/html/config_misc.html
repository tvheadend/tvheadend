 This tabs allow configuration of several general parameters that affect the
 core TVH functionality.
 </p>

 <dl>
  <dt>Default Language(s)
  <dd>
  Select the list of languages (in order of priority) to be used for supplying
  EPG information to clients that don't provide their own configuration.
  <p>
  The EPG information is NOT translated, this only applies to EPG providers
  that give information (titles, descriptions, etc..) in multiple languages.

  <dt>DVB scan files path:
  <dd>
  Select the path to use for DVB scan configuration files. Typically
  dvb-apps stores these in /usr/share/dvb/. Leave blank to use TVH's internal
  file set.
