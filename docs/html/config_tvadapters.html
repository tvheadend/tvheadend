<h4>The rows have the following functions</h4>

<dl>
  <dt>Enabled</dt>
  <dd>If selected, the IPTV service will be enabled an use for channel
      subscriptions.</dd>

  <dt>Name</dt>
  <dd>The name of this tuner.</dd>

  <dt>Full Mux Rx mode</dt>
  <dd>If selected, the whole mux (transponder) will be received without any
      filtering. It is not usually required to enable this option. It does
      not have usually any benefit, because tvheadend will filter the
      unwanted PIDs from the TS stream, except for the malfunctioning drivers.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h4>LinuxDVB specific rows</h4>

<dl>
  <dt>Keep FE open</dt>
  <dd>Enable to not close the LinuxDVB frontend device in the idle state.</dd>
</dl>      

<h4>SAT>IP specific rows</h4>

<dl>
  <dt>Full Mux Rx mode supported</dt>
  <dd>Enable, if the SAT>IP box supports the full mux rx mode (pids=all)
      parameter.</dd>
      
  <dt>Signal scale (240 or 100)</dt>
  <dd>Some SAT>IP boxes has only 0-100 scale. If your signal is too low, try
      value 100 here.</dd>
      
  <dt>Maximum PIDs<dt>
  <dd>Maximum supported PIDs in the filter of the SAT>IP box.</dd>
  
  <dt>Maximum length of PIDs<dt>
  <dd>Maximum length in characters for the command setting PIDs to the
      SAT>IP box.</dd>

  <dt>addpids/delpids supported</dt>
  <dd>Enable, if the SAT>IP box supports the addpids/delpids command.

  <dt>PIDs in setup</dt>
  <dd>Enable, if the SAT>IP box requires pids=0 parameter in the SETUP RTSP command.</dd>

  <dt>UDP RTP Port Number (2 ports)</dt>
  <dd>Force the local UDP Port number here. The number should be even (RTP port).
      The next odd number (+1) will be used as the RTCP port.</dd>

  <dt>Satellite Positions</dt>
  <dd>Select the number of satellite positions supported by the SAT>IP
      hardware and your coaxial cable wiring.</dd>

  <dt>Master Tuner</dt>
  <dd>Select the master tuner.
     <p>The signal from the standard universal LNB can be split using
        a simple coaxial splitter (no multiswitch) to several outputs.
        In this case, the position, the polarization and low-high
        band settings must be equal.</p>
     <p>If you set other tuner as master, then this tuner will act like
        a slave one and tvheadend will assure that this tuner will not
        use incompatible parameters (position, polarization, lo-hi).</p>
