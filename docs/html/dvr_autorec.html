<div class="hts-doc-text">
This tab is used to create and maintain Digital Video Recorder rules. These can be EPG-driven (such as those created from the initial EPG tab) through the DVR AutoRec Entries tab , or can be timer-based through the Time Schedules tab.
<br>
<br>
This tab controls EPG-driven recording rules.

<b>Buttons</b>
<hr>
Buttons have the following functions:
<br><br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Add</b>
<dd>
Add and configure a recording rule - define the channel, schedule, DVR configuration, priority, etc.
<p>
<dt><b>Delete</b>
<dd>
Delete an existing recording rule.
<p>
<dt><b>Edit</b>
<dd>
Manually edit an existing recording rule. This uses the same fields as <b>Add</b>, but they're pre-populated with their current values.
<p>
<dt><b>Save</b>
<dd>
Saves any changes made to the recording rule list.
<p>
<dt><b>Undo</b>
<dd>
Undoes any changes made to the recording rules list (any changed fields will be marked with a small red triangle).
<p>
</dl>

<hr>
<b>Columns</b>
<hr>
The columns have the following functions:
<br><br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Enabled</b>
<dd>
Check or clear this box to enable or disable this rule.
<p>
<dt><b>Name</b>
<dd>
The name you've given to the rule, e.g. 'Stuff involving Jeremy Clarkson'.
<p>
<dt><b>Title (Regexp)</b>
<dd>
The title of the programme to look for. Note that this accepts case-insensitive regular expressions, so you can use pattern matching as Tvheadend scans the EPG for programmes to record.
<p>
<dt><b>Channel</b>
<dd>
The channel on which this rule applies, i.e. the channel you're aiming to record.
<p>
<dt><b>Channel Tag</b>
<dd>
A channel tag (e.g. a group of channels) on which this rule applies.
<p>
<dt><b>Content Type</b>
<dd>
The content type (Movie/Drama, Sports...) to be used to filter matching events/programmes.
<p>
<dt><b>Minimal Duration</b>
<dd>
The minimal duration of a matching event - in other words, only match programmes that are no shorter than this duration.
<p>
<dt><b>Maximal Duration</b>
<dd>
The maximal duration of a matching event - in other words, only match programmes that are no longer than this duration.
<p>
<dt><b>Week Days</b>
<dd>
On which specific days of the week to find matching programmes.
<p>
<dt><b>Starting Around</b>
<dd>
An approximate starting time for matching programmes.
<br>
<br>
I'd need to check the code to see how this works to expand on this any further. It used to be:
<br>
<br>
Only record events if they are scheduled +-15 minutes from this given time.
<p>
<dt><b>Priority</b>
<dd>
The priority of any recordings set because of this rule: important, high, normal, low, unimportant.
<p>
<dt><b>DVR Configuration</b>
<dd>
The DVR configuration (e.g. extra start/stop time, post-processing rules) to be used for any recordings set because of this rule.
<p>
<dt><b>Creator</b>
<dd>
The creator of the rule. Automatically set.
<p>
<dt><b>Comment</b>
<dd>
A free-text comment. Not used otherwise.
