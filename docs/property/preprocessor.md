*Example usage*

To use special characters (e.g. spaces), either put the string in double quotes
or escape the individual characters:

```/usr/bin/lcd_show "%f"```

The command is executed as-is, without a shell. To redirect command output or
chain commands, wrap the command in a shell, e.g.

```
sh -c "df -P -h /recordings >/config/.markers/recording-pre-process"
sh -c "df -P -h /recordings | tee /config/.markers/recording-pre-process"
```
