For example, if a program is to start at 13:00 and you set a padding of 
5 minutes, it will start recording at 12:54:30 (including a warm-up 
time of 30 seconds (user configurable)). If this isn't 
specified, any pre-recording padding as set in the channel or DVR 
profile will be used. 

Be sure to check you have enough free tuners available
to record all scheduled recordings if they overlap.
