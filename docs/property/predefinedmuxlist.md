Generally an out of date mux list isn't an issue provided that you have 
*Network Discovery* enabled and a mux (in the list) with [NIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program-specific_information#NIT_.28network_information_specific_data.29) 
data scans successfully, Tvheadend will parse the NIT and then add/scan 
newly discovered muxes automatically.
