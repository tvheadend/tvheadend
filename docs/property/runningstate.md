EITp/f (Event Information Table present/following) allows broadcasters 
to tell DVRs/STBs when a program actually starts, finishes or pauses, 
unfortunately not all broadcasters get it right which can lead to 
unexpected behavior, missing/failed recordings, etc..

It is recommended that you only enable this option if you're absolutely 
sure your broadcaster sends the flags correctly and on time. 
You can set this option per channel or per DVR profile, 
enabling/disabling per channel overrides the DVR profile setting.

Per Channel Option    | Description
----------------------|------------
**Not set**           | Use DVR profile setting.
**Enabled**           | Enable running state (EITp/f) detection.
**Disabled**          | Don't use running state (EITp/f) detection.
