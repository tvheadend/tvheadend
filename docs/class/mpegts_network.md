The following tab specific buttons are available: 

Button         | Function
---------------|---------
**Force Scan** | Force a new scan (i.e. scan all muxes for services) for the selected networks.

---

###Force Scanning

Force scanning can take some time. You may continue to use Tvheadend 
while a scan is in progress, but doing so will increase the time needed 
for it to complete. Note that the time required can vary depending on a 
number of factors, such as how many tuners you have available and the 
number of muxes on each.

###IPTV Automatic Network - Don't Probe Services

Tvheadend will by default probe each playlist entry for service information. 
Some service providers do not allow such probing & will deny (or rate 
limit) access, leading to scan failures. 

To create services without probing, *Service ID* must be set 
(usually to 1) and the *Scan after creation* check box un-ticked. 

Note, the above two settings are only visible with the view level set to 
Expert.
