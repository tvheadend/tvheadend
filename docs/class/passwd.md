where you set and maintain all user passwords (e.g. for streaming or DVR access).

###Adding and Editing an Entry/Password

To add an entry press the *[Add]* button from the menu bar. 

To edit an entry highlight (select) the entry from the grid, then press the 
*[Edit]* button from the menu bar. 

Be aware that the username you enter 
must match a username/entry in the [Access Entries](class/access_entry) 
tab for it to apply. You may have multiple password entries for the 
same username if you wish.

Note that both the *[Add]* and *[Edit]* buttons display similar dialogs.

**Tip**: You can quickly make changes to an entry by double-clicking on 
the desired field within the grid. See *Editing Fields* on the [Web interface Guide - General](webui_general) 
page for details.

### Deleting an Entry.

To delete an password entry highlight (select) the entry from the grid, then press
the *[Delete]* button from the menu bar.

**Tip**: Rather than deleting an entry, you can disable it instead by 
pressing the *[Edit]* button, and unticking the "Enabled" check box.
