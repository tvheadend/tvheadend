This tab is the second part of Tvheadend's access control mechanism. It is
where you set and maintain all user passwords (e.g. for streaming or DVR access).

###Example

This is an example of a password entry.

!['Add Password dialog'](static/img/doc/passwd/add.png)

Be aware that the username you enter here must match a username/entry in 
the Access Entries tab for it to apply. You may 
have multiple password entries for the same username if you wish.
