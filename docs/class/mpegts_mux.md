## Overview

Muxes are locations at which services can be found. On traditional 
networks (DVB-C, -T and -S), these are carrier signals on which the 
individual channels are multiplexed, hence the name. However, Tvheadend 
also uses the term ‘mux’ to describe a source for multiple IP 
streams - so an IP address, in effect.
