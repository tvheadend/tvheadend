<tvh_include>inc/selecting_entries_tip</tvh_include>

**Tip**: By default Tvheadend will only show a small selection of 
available services - you can increase this by using the paging 
selector at the bottom right of the page.
  
####Mapping/Removing a Service to/from an Existing Channel

You can map/remove a service to/from an existing channel by doing the following:

**1)** Find the desired service from within the services grid. 

If you have a lot of services you may want to use filtering to limit the 
number of grid entries. You can do this by hovering your mouse over the 
*Service name* column, a down arrow â–¾ should now be visible, clicking 
the arrow will then display a list of options, move your mouse down to 
"Filters" and a text box should then appear, click on it and enter the 
desired service's name.

**Tip**: Remember to remove the filter when you're finished (uncheck the 
check box next to the "Filters" option). 

**2)** Double click on the channel field, a drop down listing of all defined 
channels will appear, check/uncheck the check box next to the channel 
you'd like to associate/disassociate the service with.
