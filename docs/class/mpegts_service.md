The [Map services to channels](class/service_mapper) will now be displayed with **all** services 
checked - feel free to make changes. Once you're happy with the selection press the "Map services" button, you will 
then be taken to the [Service Mapper](status_service_mapper) tab which 
will begin mapping the selected services to channels. 
  
####Mapping Selected

Click on the services you would like to map as channels, 
once you're done selecting press the "Map services" button and 
then "Map selected services". 

!['Map selected'](static/img/doc/mpegts_service/map_selected.png)
    
The [Map services to channels](class/service_mapper) dialog will 
now be displayed with the **selected** services checked - feel free to make 
changes. Once you're happy with the selection press the 
"Map services" button, you will then be taken to the 
[Service Mapper](status_service_mapper) tab which will begin mapping 
the selected services to channels. 

**Tip**: By default Tvheadend will only show a small selection of 
available services - you can increase this by using the paging 
selector at the bottom right of the page.
  
####Mapping/Removing a Service to/from an Existing Channel

You can map/remove a service to/from an existing channel by doing the following:

**1)** Find the desired service from within the services grid. 

If you have a lot of services you may want to use filtering to limit the 
number of grid entries. 

!['Service filtering'](static/img/doc/mpegts_service/map_selected.png)

**Tip**: Remember to remove the filter when you're finished (untick the 
check box next to the "Filters" option). 

**2)** Double click on the channel field, a drop down listing of all defined 
channels will appear, check/uncheck the check box next to the channel 
you'd like to associate/disassociate the service with.
