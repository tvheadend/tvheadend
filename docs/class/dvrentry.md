DVR entries are used by Tvheadend to keep track of upcoming/current, finished 
and failed recordings.

!['Digital Video Recorder' Tabs](docresources/configdvrtabs4.png)

  * Upcoming and currently recording entries remain in the *[Upcoming/Current Recordings](#dvr-upcoming-current-recordings)* tab.
  * When a recording completes successfully the entry is moved to the *[Finished Recordings](#dvr-finished-recordings)* tab.
  * When a recording fails or gets aborted the entry is moved to the *[Failed Recordings](#dvr-failed-recordings)* tab.
  
**Some entry details are not available/incomplete until the recording 
completes or fails, e.g. filesize, total data errors, etc.**

###Adding and Editing an Entry 

####Adding an Entry Using the EPG

Using the Electronic Program Guide search functionality, find the 
program/event you would like to record. Click on it, then using the broadcast 
details dialog you can:

* Record the event once by pressing the *[Record program]* button.
* Automatically record all upcoming events matching the program's title by pressing the *[Autorec]* button.
* Record all upcoming series episodes by pressing the *[Record series]* button. **This replaces the *[Autorec]* button when series link information is available.**

For full instructions on how to search and record using the EPG take a 
look at the [EPG](epg) page.

####Adding an Entry Using Autorec Rules

Autorec rules allow you to match events using various options. 

* Record events using regular expressions, they can be as simple or as powerful as you like.
* Record events that broadcast between certain times or days of the week.

See [Autorec](class/dvrautorec) for more information.


####Adding a Timer Event

You can set time-based entries using the [Timers](class/dvrtimerec) tab.

####Manual Event Entry/Editing an Entry

To add an entry press the *[Add]* button from the menu bar. 

To edit an entry highlight the desired entry within the grid, and 
then press the *[Edit]* button from the menu bar.

A common set of fields is used for the _Add_ or _Edit_ dialogs, most
of which can also be seen in the grid view:

###Deleting an Entry/Stopping an In-progress Recording

You can delete, stop or abort an upcoming (or an already in-progress) recording by pressing 
the *[Delete]*, *[Stop]* or *[Abort]* button from the menu bar.

* The *[Delete]* button completely removes the event and any associated file(s).
* The *[Stop]* button gracefully stops an in-progress recording and moves it to the Finished Recordings tab.
* The *[Abort]* button stops an already in-progress recording, moves the entry to the Failed Recordings and marks it as *Aborted by user*.  Note that this does not remove the (partial) recording file from disk.

Note that only in-progress recording can be stopped or aborted.

**Deleting an entry can't be undone, you will be prompted for confirmation.**
