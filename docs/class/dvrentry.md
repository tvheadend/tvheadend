This tab is where you manage your recordings. Each entry is moved 
between the *Upcoming / Current Recordings*, *Finished Recordings* and 
*Failed Recordings* sub-tabs depending on its status.

**Upcoming / Current Recordings**
: This sub-tab lists current and upcoming recording entries. Entries 
shown here are either currently recording or are soon-to-be recorded.

**Finished Recordings**
: This sub-tab lists all completed recording entries. Entries shown 
here have reached the end of the scheduled (or EITp/f defined) 
recording time.

**Failed Recordings**
: This sub-tab lists all failed recording entries. Entries shown here 
have failed to record due to one (or more) errors that occurred during 
the recording.

**Removed Recordings**
: This sub-tab lists all recording entries that have missing file(s). 
Entries shown here link to file(s) that Tvheadend cannot locate 
(files which have been externally removed).

###Adding an Entry Using the EPG

Using the Electronic Program Guide search functionality, find the 
program/event you would like to record. Click on it, then using the broadcast 
details dialog you can:

* Record the event once by pressing the *[Record program]* button.
* Automatically record all upcoming events matching the program's title by pressing the *[Autorec]* button.
* Record all upcoming series episodes by pressing the *[Record series]* button. **This replaces the *[Autorec]* button when series link information is available.**

For full instructions on how to search and record using the EPG take a 
look at the [EPG](epg) page.

###Adding an Entry Using Autorec Rules

Autorec rules allow you to match events using various options. 

* Record events using regular expressions, they can be as simple or as powerful as you like.
* Record events that broadcast between certain times or days of the week.

See [Autorec](class/dvrautorec) for more information.
