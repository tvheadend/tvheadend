The DVR entry is used by Tvheadend to keep track of the upcoming, 
finished and failed recordings.

* Upcoming and currently recording entries remain in the 'Upcoming/ 
Current Recordings' tab.
* When a recording completes successfully the entry gets moved to the 
'Finished recordings' tab.
* When a recording fails or is aborted it gets moved to the 'Failed 
recordings' tab.

Some entry details are not available/incomplete until the recording 
completes or fails, e.g. filesize, total data errors, etc.
