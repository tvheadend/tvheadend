How to build for Linux
======================

First you need to configure:

$ ./configure

If any dependencies are missing the configure script will complain.
You then have the option to disable that particular module/subsystem.

$ make

Build the binary, after build the binary resides in 'build.Linux/'.
Thus, to start it, just type:

$ build.linux/tvheadend
