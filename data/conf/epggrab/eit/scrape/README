The directory contains configuration file for general regular
expressions to be applied to the EPG.

Configuration file format
-------------------------

A configuration file is in JSON format. Possible members of the top-level
object are:

* season_num
* episode_num
* airdate
* is_new
* scrape_title
* scrape_subtitle
* scrape_summary

Each member's value is a list of regular expressions. Each regular
expression must contain at least one sub-pattern, i.e. a pattern
enclosed in (). Input data is matched against the first regex in the
list. If no match is found, the second regex is tried, and so on until
a match is found or the list exhausted. If a match is found, the result
of the match is the contents of all the sub-patterns in the regular
expression concatenated together.

For each EPG episode, the title, description and summary are matched
in turn against the season_num, episode_num, airdate and is_new regexes.

- season_num converts the contents of the match result to an integer,
  and if successful sets the EPG season number.
- episode_num converts the contents of the match result to an integer,
  and if successful sets the EPG eipsode number.
- airdate converts the contents of the match result to an integer,
  and if successful sets the EPG copyright year.
- is_new sets the EPG is_new flag on any match. Remember the regexp must
  have at least one sub-pattern to make a successful match; in this case
  the match result is ignored.

Next, a combined title/summary text is made by joining the title, a space,
and the summary. The combined text is matched against the scrape_title regex.
On a match, the EPG title is set to the match result.

Then the summary is matched against the scrape_subtitle regex. On a match,
the EPG subtitle is set to the match result.

Finally, the summary is matched against the scrape_summary regex. On a match,
the EPG summary is set to the match result.

Regular expression engine
-------------------------

The top level regular expressions are POSIX regular expressions, and are
executed using the C runtime library regular expression functions. The
expressions are treated as extended POSIX regular expressions.

If either the PCRE or the PCRE2 library are found during configuration,
that library can be used for regular expression matching. If both are
found, PCRE2 is used.

Because there are differences in regular expression facilities and
handling between POSIX, PCRE and PCRE2, you must specify an alternate
regular expression appropriate for the engine. Alternate regular
expressions are held as members of a top-level object "pcre" or "pcre2".
For example:

{
  "scrape_subtitle": [
      "^[.][.][.][^:.]*[.:] ([^.0-9][^:]*): ",
      "^[0-9]+/[0-9]+[.] +([^:]*): ",
      "^([^.0-9][^:]+): "
  ],
  "pcre": {
      "scrape_subtitle": [
          "^(?:[.][.][.][^:.]*[.:] +|[0-9]+/[0-9]+[.] +)?([^.0-9][^:]*): "
      ]
  }
}

regular expressions is at

Testing
-------

There is a test harness for these files in the development tree at
support/eitscrape_test.py with test harness files at
support/testdata/eitscrape.

WARNING: The test harness uses Python's re regular expression handling.
Python regular expressions are neither POSIX nor PCRE, though in general
they are closer to PCRE than POSIX.
